# Psychic-Game
The Psychic game is a computer app that prompts the user to guess the letter, by keystroke, that the computer is thinking of.


# Motivation
I created this game as a part of the curriculum of the Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp at UConn, offered by Trilogy. 

# Tech Used
This app was built with javascript. 

# How It Works
When the screen loads the computer chooses one letter, which is not displayed. The user/player then selects a letter using their keyboard to try to guess the letter chosen by the computer. The app grants the user nine guesses, and counts the number of guesses used by player. The app also tracks the letters chosen by the player and displays them so they don't try the same letter twice, wasting a guess. The player loses when they run out of guesses and wins when their guess matches the letter chosen by the computer. Either way, the app displays both the number of wins and losses.
